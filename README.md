## FAQ

Q: What do you mean, don't look at the code? How are you going to enforce that.

A: We can see you through our Chainguard Omniscope at all times and we will be / are monitoring you. By the way, you should consider wearing more interesting socks.

Q: No, really. Can I look at the code?

A: No.

Q: Can the AI look at the code?

A: Yes, of course. Your'e starting to get it now.

Q: I have a cool idea for the challenge, but, like, I'm worried it violates the requirements you wrote.

A: What are you, some kind of rule follower? Just do it.

Q: Can I post about my project on *teh socials*?

A: Yes, use hashtag #vibelympics and/or tag Chainguard, we'll do our best to repost / boost.

Q: Can I get a hint or something. I read this far in the FAQ and I'm probably the only one who did that.

A: Yeah, why not. We at Chainguard love talking about our beloved octopus friend Linky, burrito bowls, and wearing hats of all kinds. We also, for some reason, like to use Uber ratings as a judge of character. If you want to pander to us you can incorporate or talk about our products (Chainguard Containers, Chainguard Libraries, and Chainguard VMs) or OSS projects we're connected to (Sigstore, K8s, SLSA, Kaniko, Tekton). 

Q: Should we pander to you? Will we win if we do that?

A: Don't you ever get tired of asking questions? You do you. 👈(❛ ᗜ ❛👈)
